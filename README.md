# N Queens problem solver in Python 3

## Usage:
```
python3 solver.py [max_size] [min_size] [log_level]
 max_size  : Board maximum size, default = 14
 min_size  : Board initial size, default = 1
 log_level : Output detail shown in the process, default = 0
             Recommended only whith min_size = max_size
             0 Only show statistics
             1 Dispaly all solutions with boards
             2 Dispaly all steps in the process, queen boards
             3 Dispaly all steps in the process, attack maps
